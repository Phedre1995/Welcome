<center><h3><strong>Positions of a Noun in a Sentence</strong></h3></center>

<center>
<p>A noun can hold the following positions in a sentence: <br>Subject, direct object, indirect object, subject complement, object complement, object of a preposition, appositive, adjective.
<br>
</p>
</center>

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Noun as the Subject</u></h4></center></header>

<center><p>A noun can hold the subject position of a sentence.<br>
<strong>E.g</strong>
<ol>
<li><em>Bianca recently had a birthday.</em></li>
<li><em>Cars can modulate their speed.</em></li>
</ol>

In the first sentence, <em>Bianca</em> holds the subject position and <em>had</em> is the corresponding verb. What type of noun is this?
In the second sentence, the subject is the noun <em>cars</em>. <em>Modulate</em> is the corresponding verb.

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Noun as the Object</u></h4></center></header>

<p>
<center>
Nouns can hold the object position of a sentence. Either direct object or indirect object.
<br>
<ol>
<li><strong>E.g. As a direct object</strong>: <em>Shut down <strong>your computer</strong> before bed.</em></li>
<li><strong>E.g. As an indirect object</strong>:<em>Shut down your computer <strong>before bed</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<br>
</center></p>

</section>

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Noun as the Subject Complement</u></h4></center></header>

<center>
<p><strong>E.g.</strong><em>Humans are <strong>humans</strong>.</em>
<br>
In the above example, <strong>humans</strong> acts as the subject complement. Nouns as subject complements usually follow linking verbs such as <em>to be, to seem, to become</em>.
<br>
</p>
</center>
</section>

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Noun as the Object Complement</u></h4></center></header>

<center>
<p><strong>E.g.</strong><em>Apple trees provide cool shade <strong>on sunny days.</strong>.</em>
<br>
In the above example, the nominal (noun) phrase <strong>on sunny days</strong> acts as the object complement. It describes the direct object of the sentence.
<br>
</p>
</center>
</section>

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Noun as the Object of a Preposition</u></h4></center></header>

<center>
<p><strong>E.g.</strong><em>Apple trees provide cool shade <strong>on sunny days.</strong>.</em>
<br>
In the above example, the nominal (noun) phrase <strong>on sunny days</strong> acts as the object complement, and particularly the object of the preposition <strong>on</strong>. 
<br>
</p>
</center>
</section>

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Noun as the Appositive</u></h4></center></header>
<center>
<p>Appositive nouns are nouns that immediately follow another noun to further describe or define it.
<br><strong>E.g.</strong><em>Jessica is twelve <strong>years old</strong>.; Helen is a <strong>grease monkey</strong>.; This business is a <strong>cash cow</strong>.</em>
</center>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Noun as the Adjective</u></h4></center></header>

<center>
<p><strong>E.g.</strong><em>A <strong>love</strong> story.;A <strong>pride</strong> parade.; A <strong>foot</strong> stool.;</em>
<br>
The emboldened nouns act as modifiers and adjectives of the nouns they follow them. And vice versa.
</p>
</center>
</section>


<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Possessive Nouns</u></h4></center></header>

<center>
<p>In order to create the possessive form of noun, you need to mark the possessor with an apostrophe and an s.
<strong>E.g.</strong><em>The car<strong>'s</strong> windshield.; My shirt<strong>'s</strong> collar.; This house is <strong>mine</strong>. It is your<strong>s</strong>.</em>
<br><strong>Mine</strong> is an exception to the rule of "s" with possessiveness.
</p>
</center>
</section>

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Plural Nouns</u></h4></center></header>

<center>
<p>In order to create the possessive form of nouns, unlike collective nouns, you need to conjugate it to a plural verb, and end the word with an "s"or "es". Although there are many exceptions to this rule.
<strong>E.g.</strong><em>The car<strong>s</strong> are in the lot. (car); Butterfl<strong>ies</strong> scare me. (butterflies); Ox<strong>en</strong> are bred in farms.(Ox);</em>
<br>The plural nouns are <strong>conjugated with a plural verb</strong>. Whereas a collective noun (e.g. Troop) is conjugated with a singular verb (see KASSCON LESSON 3).
</p>

<section>
<header><center><h4><u>Countable Nouns and Uncountable Nouns</u></h4></center></header>

<center>
<p>Much like the name describes, there exist <strong>countable nouns which can easily be counted, and uncountbale which are too difficult to keep track of</strong>.
<br> Countable nouns can be measured by the following articles: <strong>a/an, the, many, a few, a couple, some, many</strong>. 
<br>On the other hand, uncountable nouns are too difficult to count, and can be measured with: <strong>a lot of, a little, much, some, any</strong>.
<br><strong>E.g.</strong><em>A little food; Five cars; a lot of milk; There aren't any shoes; There isn't any rice.
<br> Uncountable nouns take a singular verb, because they are seen as one entity.
